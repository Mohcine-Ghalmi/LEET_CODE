# 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a 
palindrome or false otherwise.

<b>palindrome : A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.</b>

## Example 1:

![Alt text](img/image1.png)

        Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
        Output: true
## Example 2:
![Alt text](img/image.png)
        Input: head = [1,2]
        Output: false
 

## Constraints:

        The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
        0 <= Node.val <= 9
